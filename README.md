# React Interview

### What is React.js

- It's a popular, component-based, declarative, state-driven, one-way data flow javascript library for building user interfaces.

### Important concept

1. **Library or framework:**
   It's a famous **JS library**, like a toolbox with different tools you can install. When you put all the tools togather, React acts like a complete framewormk.

2. **Components based:**
   A component is a small re-useable piece of code that can be used again and again. Components are the building blocks of User Interface in React.

3. **Declarative:**
   "Do not touch the DOM, I will do all the work for you", which means we have to understand the rendering approachs. **Vanilla JS (Imperative approach) and React JS (Declarative approach)**, which means developers describe how the user interface should look based on its current state, and React takes care of updating the DOM (Document Object Model) accordingly. This Declarative nature of React makes it easier to build and maintain complex UIs.

4. **State driven:**
   The main goal of React is to sync the data with User Interface. In React, you can call the data as **State**, because state is used to store data. So the **DOM manipulation** part is handled by the state in React.

5. **One-way data flow:**
   React enforces a unidirectional data flow. Data flows from the top-level component down to child components. Parent components pass data to their children via props, and children communicate back to parents through callbacks.
